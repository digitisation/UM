            <p>I.
                <br/> Something happened.
                <br/> something changed
                <br/> the porosity of
                <br/> my skin and
                <br/> it lets everything in
                <br/> it allows
                <br/> it surrenders
                <br/> more unknown
                <br/> porous permeable
                <br/> like a thirsty stone
                <br/> like an open door
                <br/> all these intensities
                <br/> who knew
                <br/> how to find the ore
                <br/> a pallindrome hole
                <br/> things are seeping out too
                <br/> from this skin
                <br/> this dark skin
                <br/> I’ve always
                <br/> known it to be thin</p>
            <br/>
            <p>III.
                <br/> Where are they going?
                <br/> the things you have done
                <br/> the extravasated
                <br/> conversations
                <br/> the urea of the
                <br/> words absorbed
                <br/>Swallowed whole like
                <br/> a snake a swollen violin
                <br/> the body is full
                <br/> of words and holes
                <br/> your mother felt it on her skin,
                <br/>she knows it
                <br/> she doesn’t have to look
                <br/> she points to letters and
                <br/> words appear,
                <br/> her skin
                <br/> the fingers
                <br/> let everything in </p>
            <br/>
            <p>II.
                <br/> When it’s quiet …
                <br/> the organs speak
                <br/> thick vert from the skin
                <br/> a colourful ceremony
                <br/> it is not blood let out
                <br/> it’s little cries
                <br/> a thin river of viscous lava
                <br/> the liver voiced
                <br/> the ones who touch know it
                <br/> we know
                <br/> the skin doesn’t hide
                <br/> anything anymore
                <br/> imagine a sieve
                <br/> and every hole
                <br/> a corridor a labyrinth
                <br/> a subcutaneous sea
                <br/> you can’t see
                <br/> but something happened here,
                <br/> under the skin
                <br/> and it lets everything in </p>
            <br/>
            <p>IV.
                <br/> I was standing in the rain...
                <br/> And I thought
                <br/> ‘I will drown
                <br/> or melt or float’
                <br/> All the doors
                <br/> Open
                <br/> All The windows
                <br/> with no panes
                <br/> I didn’t know
                <br/> salty and hot
                <br/> the rain is coming in
                <br/> All the furniture wet
                <br/> Nowhere to sit
                <br/> The water is rising
                <br/> The skin is letting
                <br/> everything in
                <br/> so slippery so thin
                <br/> welcome
                <br/> come in amen</p>
